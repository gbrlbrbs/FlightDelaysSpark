# Flight Delays and Cancellations Analysis in Spark

This is a repository that analyzes the US Department of Transportation data on flight delays and cancellations avalaible on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018). Since the data is extensive and hard to load in-memory, this repository implements a Spark dockerized cluster to process the data.
